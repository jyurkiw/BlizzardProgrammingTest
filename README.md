# BlizzardProgrammingTest

By Jeffrey Yurkiw

This is a solution to the Blizzard .Net Engineer Take Home Test.

It is an application that allows managment of a World of Warcraft player's characters.

# Instructions

To build the application, double-click on the BlizzardProgrammingTest.sln file in the top directory. You must have Visual Studio 2015 installed (I use the community edition.)

To run the C# tests, use the Visual Studio test explorer. It can be found in the Test -> Windows  menu (Test Explorer).

To run the JavaScript tests, you'll need NPM installed. Just open the BlizzardProgrammingTest/BlizzardProgrammingTest/scripts directory in a console (NPM must be installed and in your path), and use the "npm test" command. All dependencies have already been installed (you can run "npm install" first if you want). If you don't have NPM installed and won't install it for this, and/or want to read the JS tests anyway they're in the scripts/test directory.

# Introduction

When the application starts, the user will take on the role of a new player with a clean sheet of characters.

* The player can add characters to their account.
* The player can delete characters from their account.
* The player can un-delete characters from their account.

New characters can be added to the account.

* The player can select the character's race (race decided faction).
* The selected race can limit the available class options.
* The player can give the new character a name.

The available factions are: Alliance or Horde.

The Alliance has the following races:
* Human
* Gnome
* Worgen

The Horde has the following races:
* Orc
* Tauren
* Blood Elf

The following classes are available:
* Warrior
* Mage
* Druid
* Death Knight

* Humans and Gnomes can be Warriors, Mages, and Death Knights.
* Worgen can be Warriors, Mages, Druids, and Death Knights.
* Orcs can be Warriors, Mages, and Death Knights.
* Tauren can be Warriors, Mages, Druids, and Death Knights.
* Blood Elves can be Mages, and Death Knights.

To create a Death Knight a player must already have an active (not-deleted) character at level 55 or above.

# Technical Requirements
The application runs on a clean build directly from a git clone operation out of the primary repo master branch provided Nuget isn't blocked.

The project uses AngularJS for the front-end, and ASP.Net for the back-end. The front-end is an angularjs single-page application while the back-end API uses Microsoft's .NET Web Api 2.

The front-end is data-driven using the same back-end system that manages characters. It's an in-memory store using a singleton pattern that persists across connections so long as you don't restart the server. The data-set that is used to create the faction/class/race combinations in the character creator is also used to validate all characters that are created. Any character that don't adhere to the faction + class + race combinations present in the back-end is not created.

Data persistence is in-memory and on-disk (see issue #1).

Authentication is handled through Windows Authentication. If you are signed into your computer, you are signed into the application (see issue #2).

Unit testing was performed on the front and back-ends where we would not simply be testing Microsoft's and Google's code. (see issue #3)

# Technical Issues

1. Disk-persistence only works if you shut down the application through the actual IIS interface. Just hitting the red stop-box in Visual Studio kills the application and prevents the write-process from firing. In order to persist between runs, you need to go to the "Show Hidden Icons" arrow on your windows task bar (the icon bar on the bottom of your desktop), right-click the icon for IIS Express, go to Sites -> BlizzardProgrammingTest -> Stop Site. This will allow the application to stop normally, and will properly fire the Application_Stop event. If you just Stop Debugging in VS, it will cause an abrupt process termination that skips all the end-application events. As far as I've been able to find, this is a limitation of IIS Express and ASP.NET.

2. There is no backup plan for authentication besides windows auth, and anon auth is not enabled. The application does not have a sign-in page so if Windows auth is disabled (because, say, you're using Mac or 'nix without some sort of LDAP auth token set up for AD) you'll probably see the application blow up. This limitation is purely time-constrained.

3. Test coverage is light, however I feel the big areas were hit. The overall application structure was very straightforward, and so the more complex data-transforming methods were made a testing priority. The tests written for the class columnization in the front-end character creation controller test file actually uncovered a number of issues with the columnization that were then fixed. Particularly, while the columnization routine was dividing the data up into columns, the exact behavior at the edges was wrong. Especially with a large number of classes.

# Assumptions

1. Characters are created at level 1. This does mean that Death Knights cannot be created without shutting the application down, and changing the data that has been written to file.

2. I'm assuming my awesome orc drawing in the character creator is adequate for all race and class combinations. He's just that awesome.

3. I assumed that duplicate names were okay because it was not specified in the test document to be illegal. If this was not the intention we can put the feature into the next development cycle as a priority, assuming the stake holders don't want a more robust solution that allows duplicate names.
