# BlizzardProgrammingTest

By Jeffrey Yurkiw

This is a solution to the Blizzard .Net Engineer Take Home Test.

It is an application that allows managment of a World of Warcraft player's characters.

When the application starts, the user will take on the role of a new player with a clean sheet of characters.

* The player can add characters to their account.
* The player can delete characters from their account.
* The player can un-delete characters from their account.

New characters can be added to the account.

* The player can select the character's race (race decided faction).
* The selected race can limit the available class options.
* The player can give the new character a name.

The available factions are: Alliance or Horde.

The Alliance has the following races:
* Human
* Gnome
* Worgen

The Horde has the following races:
* Orc
* Tauren
* Blood Elf

The following classes are available:
* Warrior
* Mage
* Druid
* Death Knight

* Humans and Gnomes can be Warriors, Mages, and Death Knights.
* Worgen can be Warriors, Mages, Druids, and Death Knights.
* Orcs can be Warriors, Mages, and Death Knights.
* Tauren can be Warriors, Mages, Druids, and Death Knights.
* Blood Elves can be Mages, and Death Knights.

To create a Death Knight a player must already have an active (not-deleted) character at level 55 or above.
